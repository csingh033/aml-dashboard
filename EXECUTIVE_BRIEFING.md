# üéØ Fraud Ring Detection: Executive Briefing

## üö® The Problem
**Traditional AML systems miss 90%+ of sophisticated fraud networks**
- Criminals use multiple identities and accounts to evade simple rules  
- Manual investigations take 4-6 hours per case
- 95% of alerts are false positives, wasting investigator time
- Regulatory fines for AML failures average $2.9M per incident

---

## ‚úÖ Our Solution
**AI-powered network analysis that finds hidden fraud relationships**

### **What It Does:**
1. **Analyzes all transactions** to find suspicious patterns
2. **Groups related beneficiaries** despite name variations  
3. **Identifies "hub" networks** - one account receiving from many senders
4. **Prioritizes high-risk cases** using intelligent scoring
5. **Provides visual evidence** for fast investigation

### **Key Innovation:**
Instead of flagging individual transactions, we **map entire fraud networks** and show investigators exactly how the scheme works.
